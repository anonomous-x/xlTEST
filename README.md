# Welcome to xlTEST!

xlTEST is a non-trivial, self organising test management system built in Excel.

The idea was that colleagues in the consultancy I was working for had no way to script, manage and track testing activities because a lot of our clients were either not prioritising spend for testing and often had security measures in place blocking access to inline free tools.

But everyone has access to Microsoft Excel! 

So I built a solution in MS Excel with automated creation and management of artifacts and basically replicated most of the best-in-field solutions for test management, but kept it simple and reusable so that it was easy to manage and the users could leave it behind with clients as test evidence.

# Features

## Assumptions and disclaimers

That the user is a competent user of Microsoft Excel and can handle different worksheets and excel files created by the system.

That the user is opening this in Microsoft Excel on Windows and not in other versions of compatible software like Open Office or Office Libre, etc. and possibly not MacOS. 

The risk is on the user in those solutions as it has only been configured and built using the WindowsOS version of Microsoft Excel so it can be as predictable (and boring!) as possible to integrate with most computing environments and supprted tech stacks.

I built this, but it was a while ago and even though I would be happy for requests for updates or feedback on the solution, it is supplied with the knowledge I will be keeping an eye out but not actively watching the project to support it.
